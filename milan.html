            <h2>Milan, Italy</h2>
            <p class = "opening">While Milan (Milano) may not be the first city a tourist thinks of when planning a trip to Italy, it has more than its share of attractions, not to mention history. For all its workaholic reputation as the money and business center of Italy, it's a city with an influential past and a rich cultural heritage.</p>

            <h3>Main Attractions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Il Duomo (Milan Cathedral)</li>
                <p>The massive Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente, which the Milanese call just "Il Duomo" is among the world's largest (it holds up to 40,000 people) and most magnificent churches, the ultimate example of the Flamboyant Gothic style.</p>
                <!-- Reference: https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/milan-i-lo-m.htm-->
                <li>Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II</li>
                <p>Forming one side of Piazza del Duomo and opening on the other side to Piazza della Scala, the grand Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II was designed by Giuseppe Mengoni and built between 1865 and 1877. It was then the largest shopping arcade in Europe, with a dome soaring 48 meters above its mosaic floor.</p>

                <li>Pinacoteca di Brera</li>
                <p>The Renaissance Palazzo di Brera, built between 1651 and 1773, was originally a Jesuit college, but since 1776 has been the Accademia di Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts).</p>

                <li>Naviglio</li>
                <p>For the young people who frequent the canal-side caf√©s and music clubs, Naviglio is one of the top things to do in Milan at night. </p>

                <li>Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper</li>
                <p>The Gothic brick church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in the Corso Magenta, was begun about 1465, and its massive six-sided dome in the finest Early Renaissance style was designed by Bramante, one of Italy's most influential Renaissance architects.</p>
