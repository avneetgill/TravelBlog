            <h2>Porto, Portugal</h2>
            <p class = "opening">Opening up like a pop-up book from the banks of the Rio Douro, edgy-yet-opulent Porto entices with its historic centre, sumptuous food and wine, and charismatic locals.</p>

            <h3>Main Attractions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Igreja de São Francisco</li>
                <p>The Church of Saint Francis is the most prominent Gothic monument in Porto, Portugal, being also noted for its outstanding Baroque inner decoration.</p>
                <!-- Reference: https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-porto-portugal/ -->
                <li>Cais da Ribeira</li>
                <p>A little chaotic and great fun to explore, Porto’s riverside area is a very picturesque piazza where tourists and locals mingle. There are bars and restaurants around every corner, and these line the riverside walk too.</p>
                <!-- Reference: https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-porto-portugal/ -->
                <li>Luís I Bridge</li>
                <p>An industrial symbol for Porto, this twin-level metal arched bridge opened in 1886. It was conceived by the German engineer Théophile Seyrig who cofounded the Eiffel Company.</p>
                <!-- Reference: https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-porto-portugal/ -->
                <li>Foz do Douro</li>
                <p>A trendy district where the Douro enters the Ocean. There’s a long promenade with palms and pines, and a pergola that you might recognise if you’ve been to Nice.</p>
                <!-- Reference: https://www.thecrazytourist.com/25-best-things-porto-portugal/ -->
                <li>Porto Cathedral</li>
                <p>Despite going through a lot of changes over time, the cathedral has kept big pieces of its original 12th-century architecture.</p>
